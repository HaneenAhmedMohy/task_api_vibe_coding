# Task API – Vibe Coding Assignment

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates different **vibe coding methods** applied to building a RESTful Task Management API.
Each session represents a different AI collaboration model, with a final refined version.

The API supports full CRUD operations, filtering, validation, persistence, and testing.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** FastAPI  
- **Database:** SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM)  
- **Validation:** Pydantic  
- **Testing:** Pytest  

---

## API Features
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Filter tasks by **status** and **priority**
- SQLite persistence
- Input validation and error handling
- RESTful design with proper HTTP status codes
- Automated tests (minimum 5 test cases)

---

## Task Model
Each task includes:
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `status` (pending / in-progress / completed)
- `priority` (low / medium / high)
- `created_at`

---

## Documenting the Process 

Each implementation folder contains a `prompts.md` file documenting:

- The **AI collaboration model** used
- The **exact prompts** sent to the AI
- The **AI-generated responses**


## Models Used
- **Iterative Conversational Collaboration Model (ICCM)**
- **Test-Driven Model (TDM)**
